if you look at the world, what you see is things appearing and disappearing, and humans are a part of the whole of that, and humans appear and they disappear. Off the face of the Earth. That just happens.
You know, our egos personalize it and we consider ourselves special cases. But we're really not, you know? We are a part of the whole and everything in the whole transforms all the time. It changes form. Transfigures.
